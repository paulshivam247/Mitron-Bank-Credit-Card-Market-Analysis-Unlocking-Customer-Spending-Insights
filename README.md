Mitron Bank Credit Card Market Analysis: Unlocking Customer Spending Insights
🚀 Project Overview
This Power BI project, developed for Codebasics Resume Project Challenge 8, is a pilot analysis for Mitron Bank, a legacy financial institution in Hyderabad. The goal is to analyze customer spending behavior, income utilization, and credit card potential to design data-driven credit card offerings.
